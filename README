### ABOUT ###
#############
The name munojabo stands for "munin jabber notification bot". Munojabo is a
script that is designed to be called by munin when the values monitored by munin
leave the "warning" or "critical" range.

####################
### INSTALLATION ###
####################
The script requires xmpp.py, under Debian/Ubuntu, this script is available as
the python-xmpp package. To test if the right library is installed, simply
execute the script with no parameters, it will throw an import-error upon
startup.

To install the script, simply copy it to any place you like. It is usually good
to copy it into a directory that is in the PATH environment variable, the best
place usually is /usr/local/bin.

#####################
### CONFIGURATION ###
#####################
This script requires a config-file located at /etc/munojabo.conf. An example
configuration file can be found in this directory. Just fill in the appropriate
details.

To configure munin to use this script, add a contact line like this to your
munin.conf:

contact.you.command <munojabo.py> <your_jid> ${var:host} "${var:graph_title}" \
	"--warnings=${loop<;>:wfields \
		${var:label}=${var:value},${var:wrange},${var:crange}}" \
	"--critical=${loop<;>:cfields \
		${var:label}=${var:value},${var:wrange},${var:crange}}" \
	"--unknown=${loop<;>:ufields \
		${var:label}=${var:value},${var:wrange},${var:crange}}"

Replace <munojabo.py> with the path to the script (or just "munojabo.py" if it
is in your PATH). Also replace <your_jid> with the jid that should receive the
notifications. You can optionally include a resource, without a given resource,
the resource with the highest resource will receive the message.

All in all, a call to the script might look something like this:
	munojabo.py mati@fsinf.at pluto.htu.tuwien.ac.at Temperature --warnings= --critical=foo=5,,7: --unknown=

Note that the contact-line given above is not enough munin-configuration, since
munin has to be configured to send warnings at all. This is outside the scope of
this file, so please visit this page:
